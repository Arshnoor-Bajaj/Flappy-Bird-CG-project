# Flappy-Bird-CG-project
Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Flappy, which is navigated by the player through pairs of pipes.

Game Concept and Design:
•	In Flappy Bird, the objective is to navigate a bird through a series of pipes without colliding with them.
•	Includes designing the game’s visual elements (birds, pipes, background).
•	Determining the game mechanics, such as how the bird will move, how the pipes will generate, and how the scoring system will work.
